          <p>The federal minimum wage in the United States has been $7.25 per hour since 2009 — the longest period without an increase since the minimum wage was established in 1938. Meanwhile, the cost of living has increased significantly over this period.</p>
          
          <h3>Current State</h3>
          <p>As of 2026, 30 states and D.C. have minimum wages above the federal level. Several cities have set their minimum wages at $15 or higher, including Seattle, San Francisco, and New York City.</p>
          
          <h3>Economic Context</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Federal minimum wage: $7.25/hour ($15,080/year for full-time)</li>
            <li>Raising to $15 would affect approximately 27 million workers</li>
            <li>Minimum wage has lost about 17% of its purchasing power since 2009</li>
            <li>Productivity has increased by over 60% since 1970 while minimum wage has not kept pace</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="perspective-context">
          <h3>Who Holds This View</h3>
          <p>Labor unions, progressive Democrats, and advocacy groups argue that a $15 minimum wage is necessary to ensure a living wage. This view is particularly popular among low-income workers, young workers, and those in service industries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>Proponents argue that the minimum wage was originally designed to be a living wage — enough to cover basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare. They contend that $7.25 is simply not enough to survive in any major American city.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            "A full-time worker earning $7.25 an hour earns just $15,080 a year — below the federal poverty line for a family of two."
          </blockquote>
          
          <h3>Key Arguments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Living Wage:</strong> $15 would bring the minimum wage back in line with its original purpose as a living wage</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Boost:</strong> Low-wage workers would spend additional income, stimulating the economy</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Inequality:</strong> Helps address growing wealth inequality</li>
            <li><strong>Business Benefits:</strong> Reduces turnover, increases productivity, and improves worker morale</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Who Holds This View</h3>
          <p>Business owners, conservative economists, and Republicans express concerns about the economic impact of a $15 minimum wage. This view is often held by small business owners, particularly in lower-cost regions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>Critics worry that a sudden jump to $15 per hour would have significant negative consequences for businesses, particularly small enterprises, and could potentially lead to job losses or reduced hiring.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            "A 100% increase in labor costs would force businesses to cut jobs, raise prices, or close entirely."
          </blockquote>
          
          <h3>Key Arguments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Job Losses:</strong> Businesses may automate or reduce headcount to offset higher labor costs</li>
            <li><strong>Price Increases:</strong> Businesses would pass costs to consumers, potentially hurting the very people minimum wage is meant to help</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Differences:</strong> A national $15 minimum wage doesn't account for cost-of-living differences between states</li>
            <li><strong>Training Barriers:</strong> Higher wages could reduce opportunities for entry-level workers and youth</li>

          <h3>Tensions and Trade-offs</h3>
          <p>The minimum wage debate reveals genuine tensions that don't have easy answers. There's legitimate concern for workers struggling to survive on low wages, but also real concerns about economic disruption from rapid changes.</p>
          
          <h3>Questions We're Missing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What role should automation play in this debate? (McDonald's has already replaced cashiers with kiosks)</li>
            <li>Should there be a regional cost-of-living adjustment instead of a flat national rate?</li>
            <li>What about non-wage benefits that many low-wage jobs offer, like health insurance?</li>
            <li>Is the issue really the minimum wage, or should we focus on education and training?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Common Ground</h3>
          <p>Interestingly, both sides agree that $7.25 is too low. Even critics often support gradual increases or regional approaches. The debate is really about the speed and scope of change, not whether any change is needed.</p>
